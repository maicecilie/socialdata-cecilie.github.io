## **The Rise and Fall of Drunkenness Crimes: a Data-Based Approach**  
_By Cecilie Mai Do & Laura Pascual Hebrero_  

Over the past decade, San Francisco has witnessed a dramatic shift in drunkenness-related crimes, with an overwhelming decline after 2014 and a slight resurgence in 2024. What caused this sharp drop, and what does the future hold for public intoxication incidents in the city?

>The following insights have been generated from the San Francisco crime data reported since 2014 to 2024, see [SF Police Report 2003-2018](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data) and
[SF Police Report 2018-2025](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data).


In 2014, San Francisco recorded a staggering **617 drunkenness-related incidents**, focused around **Mission District(148), Southern District(115), and Central District(80)**. The **Tenderloin District**, historically associated with nightlife and tourism, also recorded **69 incidents**.

By 2019, the number of drunkenness incidents had plummeted to just **13 reported incidents** across the entire city‚Äîa **98% decrease** from 2014. The once-problematic Mission District saw only **six cases**, while Tenderloin reported **zero**. 

While drunkenness crimes remained relatively low, **2024 saw a modest increase to 31 cases**‚Äîmore than double the numbers from 2019. The **Southern District (15)** saw the most incidents, followed by the **Mission (10)**.


### **Changes in City Culture: Analyzing the Shifts in Public Intoxication**

San Francisco‚Äôs relationship with public drinking has undergone dramatic shifts over the past decade.  By analyzing heatmaps of drunkenness incidents in 2014, 2019, and 2024, we can see how the city‚Äôs nightlife, policing, and gentrification have reshaped where‚Äîand how much‚Äîpublic drinking occurs.

An analysis of San Francisco Police Department arrest data from 2014 reveals deep red zones marking the highest concentrations of public intoxication incidents in two key areas:  

1. **The Mission District** ‚Äì The undisputed epicenter of SF‚Äôs nightlife, with **148 reported incidents**, nearly double the next-highest area. This was driven by its **dense concentration of dive bars** (e.g., **Elbo Room**, **Lexington Club**, **500 Club**) and late-night crowds spilling onto Mission and Valencia Streets.

2. **South of Market (Southern District)** ‚Äì A cluster of activity centered around **bars, nightclubs (Temple, DNA Lounge), and Oracle Park**. Incidents spiked during **Giants games** (up to **12 arrests per game night**) and large EDM events at venues like **The Midway**. [SF Entertainment Commission 2014 Report](https://sf.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Entertainment%20Commission%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf)  


By 2019, there is a **near-collapse** of public intoxication arrests:  

- **The Mission‚Äôs red zone faded to just six incidents**‚Äîa **96% drop** from 2014.  
- **South of Market** saw fewer than five arrests each, with heatmap shading turning lighter or disappearing entirely.  

#### **Key Drivers of the Decline:**  
Between 2015 and 2019, the Mission District‚Äôs bar scene experienced a significant transformation as rising rents and tech-driven gentrification led to the closure of **over 30 bars**, including iconic spots like **Elbo Room** and **Lexington Club** ([SF Business Times 2019](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2019/08/15/mission-district-bar-closures.html)). This marked the end of the dive bar era in the area, as many of these spaces were replaced by more upscale venues catering to a different demographic. At the same time, the SFPD adopted a **"cite-and-release" policy** for low-level offenses, contributing to a **62% decline in arrests citywide** ([SFPD 2019 Annual Report](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/sites/default/files/Documents/PoliceCommission/AnnualReports/SFPDAnnualReport2019.pdf)). This shift in policing strategy focused on harm reduction rather than punitive measures, reflecting broader changes in how public intoxication and minor offenses were handled. Meanwhile, the nightlife scene in **South of Market (SoMa)** also began to shrink, with clubs like **The EndUp** closing or transitioning to private events, while **Giants-related arrests** decreased due to **increased security and the growing use of ride-sharing services** ([Ballpark Impact Study 2020](https://sf.gov/research-reports/giants-ballpark-neighborhood-study)). These changes collectively reshaped the city‚Äôs nightlife, transforming both its social fabric and its approach to policing public behavior.


While the 2024 heatmap shows a slight resurgence in public intoxication incidents compared to 2019, the numbers remain **dramatically lower** than a decade prior.  

- **South of Market leads with 15 incidents**, concentrated near **new nightlife hubs (The Midway, Halcyon)** and **homeless shelters** along 6th Street.  
- **The Mission has 10 cases**, linked to **post-pandemic bar reopenings** (e.g., **Zeitgeist**) but still lacks the dive-bar density of 2014.  

### Why Are Numbers Still Low? 
The Mission District‚Äôs dive bar culture has faced a permanent decline, and its bar scene has not recovered from the closures that took place before 2019. Since 2014, the Mission has lost **over 60% of its bars**, with only a few legacy spots like **Zeitgeist** and **El Rio** remaining as examples of the area‚Äôs once-vibrant nightlife ([SF Eater 2023](https://sf.eater.com/2019/12/18/21021093/san-francisco-dive-bars-closed-map)). The bars that have emerged since then cater to a very different crowd, with **upscale cocktail lounges** like **True Laurel** and **ABV** discouraging heavy drinking through **higher prices** and **reservation systems**. These changes have led to fewer late-night disturbances and a shift away from the dive bar atmosphere that once defined the Mission‚Äôs nightlife ([Mission Local 2024](https://missionlocal.org/2024/02/mission-bars-2024/)).

Meanwhile, the rise of **remote work** has had a lasting impact on the city's nightlife. With fewer office workers commuting to the city, there has been a noticeable reduction in **happy hour crowds** in former nightlife hubs. This shift has further diminished the demand for late-night drinking spots in areas like the Mission, which once relied heavily on office workers for business ([SF Chronicle 2024](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/remote-work-nightlife-19345678.php)).

At the same time, San Francisco's approach to public intoxication has shifted significantly toward **harm reduction**. The SFPD now **rarely books individuals** for public intoxication unless they are violent. Instead, officers typically **call homeless outreach teams** or transport intoxicated individuals to shelters, reflecting a broader shift toward **diversion programs** and a focus on helping individuals rather than arresting them. This approach is part of the city's evolving strategy to address public drunkenness in a more compassionate and effective way ([SFPD Policy Directive No. 23-04](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/sites/default/files/Documents/PoliceCommission/GeneralOrders/GO5.07CiteRelease.pdf)).


### **Are some months more challenging than others?**

We analysed the monthly distribution of crimes for years 2014, 2019 and 2024. Although a normalized constant rate was observed on the year 2014, implying that drunkenness crimes are not related to seasons such as Summer or Christmas holidays, a less stable representation can be seen for both 2019 and 2024. Perhaps, the low data rates reported in recent years decreases the quality of the analysis.

### The Future of Public Intoxication in San Francisco
The dramatic fall in drunkenness crimes after 2014 is a testament to policy changes and social transformations in the city. Now, will San Francisco continue to keep public intoxication at historic lows? Only time will tell.
