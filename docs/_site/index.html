<h2 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-drunkenness-crimes-a-data-based-approach"><strong>The Rise and Fall of Drunkenness Crimes: a Data-Based Approach</strong></h2>
<p><em>By Cecilie Mai Do &amp; Laura Pascual Hebrero</em></p>

<p>Over the past decade, San Francisco has witnessed a dramatic shift in drunkenness-related crimes, with an overwhelming decline after 2014 and a slight resurgence in 2024. What caused this sharp drop, and what does the future hold for public intoxication incidents in the city?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following insights have been generated from the San Francisco crime data reported since 2014 to 2024, see <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data">dataset</a>. TODO: add other dataset</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2014, San Francisco recorded a staggering <strong>617 drunkenness-related incidents</strong>, focused around <strong>Mission District(148), Southern District(115), and Central District(80)</strong>. The <strong>Tenderloin District</strong>, historically associated with nightlife and tourism, also recorded <strong>69 incidents</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/drunkenness-bar-plot.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>By 2019, the number of drunkenness incidents had plummeted to just <strong>13 reported incidents</strong> across the entire city‚Äîa <strong>98% decrease</strong> from 2014. The once-problematic Mission District saw only <strong>six cases</strong>, while Tenderloin reported <strong>zero</strong>.</p>

<p>While drunkenness crimes remained relatively low, <strong>2024 saw a modest increase to 31 cases</strong>‚Äîmore than double the numbers from 2019. The <strong>Southern District (15)</strong> saw the most incidents, followed by the <strong>Mission (10)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-city-culture-analyzing-the-shifts-in-public-intoxication">Changes in City Culture: Analyzing the Shifts in Public Intoxication</h3>

<p>To understand the changing patterns of public intoxication in San Francisco, we analyzed heatmaps for 2014, 2019, and 2024, which provide a visual representation of how drunkenness-related incidents have shifted across the city‚Äôs neighborhoods.</p>

<p><img src="/images/heatmap-2014.png" alt="image" />

<img src="/images/heatmap-2024.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In 2014, the heatmap showed significant concentrations of public intoxication incidents, particularly in South of Market (SoMa), the Mission District, and the Tenderloin, all marked with high-intensity red zones. These areas were major hotspots for public drunkenness, with the Mission District and Tenderloin experiencing the highest rates of incidents, likely due to their dense populations and high foot traffic. The Mission District, in particular, has long been a hub for cultural and social activity, with a high concentration of bars and restaurants. According to the San Francisco Examiner (2017), the area‚Äôs vibrant nightlife contributed to a culture of public drinking, which likely fueled these high levels of drunkenness-related incidents. The Tenderloin, with its mix of nightlife, low-income housing, and tourist attractions, similarly struggled with public drunkenness. As noted in the San Francisco Chronicle (2018), the district has faced challenges with homelessness and substance abuse, which exacerbated the issues of public intoxication. These factors made the Mission and Tenderloin two key focal points for public drunkenness in 2014.</p>

<p>By 2019, the heatmap revealed a dramatic reduction in these hot spots, with fewer high-intensity zones across the city. Areas like the Mission and Tenderloin, once at the epicenter of public drunkenness, saw marked reductions in incidents. This aligns with the significant drop in drunkenness-related crimes shown in the bar plot, which indicated a 98% decrease in reported cases from 2014. The Mission District, once known for its lively nightlife scene, experienced a significant decrease in drunkenness-related incidents. The district‚Äôs cultural landscape had shifted, and policies targeting public intoxication, combined with changes in social dynamics like the decline of bar culture, played a role in this reduction. With fewer incidents in the Tenderloin as well, this decline could also be attributed to law enforcement measures and city policies designed to reduce public intoxication. These changes, captured in the heatmap and the bar plot, illustrated the city‚Äôs progress in addressing public drunkenness.</p>

<p>In 2024, however, the heatmap showed a slight resurgence in areas such as SoMa and the Mission District, indicating that while public drunkenness was still far below 2014 levels, there was a small uptick in certain neighborhoods. This increase likely reflects the post-pandemic return of nightlife and public events, as social spaces and bars reopened, leading to more public gatherings and, consequently, more incidents of public intoxication. SoMa had seen a rise in its nightlife scene in recent years, with a growing number of bars and event venues attracting large crowds, particularly on weekends. The area‚Äôs proximity to tech offices and the Chase Center, which hosts large events, likely contributed to this resurgence. As a result, SoMa became a hot spot once again, as shown in the 2024 heatmap. Similarly, the Mission District, while still experiencing a reduction in drunkenness-related incidents compared to 2014, showed a slight increase, likely tied to the reopening of its many bars and restaurants as part of the city‚Äôs recovery.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-public-intoxication-in-san-francisco">The Future of Public Intoxication in San Francisco</h2>

<p>The dramatic fall in drunkenness crimes after 2014 is a testament to policy changes and social transformations in the city. However, the slight rise in 2024 raises questions about whether the trend may reverse as nightlife culture regains momentum. Will San Francisco continue to keep public intoxication at historic lows, or are we seeing the early signs of a resurgence? Only time will tell.</p>
