## **The Rise and Fall of Drunkenness Crimes in San Francisco: a Data-Based Approach**  
_By Cecilie Mai Do & Laura Pascual Hebrero_  

Over the past decade, San Francisco has witnessed a dramatic shift in drunkenness-related crimes, with an overwhelming decline after 2014 and a slight resurgence in 2024. What caused this sharp drop, and what does the future hold for public intoxication incidents in the city?

>The following insights have been generated from the San Francisco crime data reported since 2014 to 2024, see [dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data). TODO: add other dataset

## A High in 2014

In 2014, San Francisco recorded a staggering **617 drunkenness-related incidents**, with the **Mission (148), Southern (115), and Central (80) districts** leading the way. Late-night revelers, particularly those out past midnight, contributed to significant numbers of arrests, peaking between **12 AM and 3 AM**. The Tenderloin, historically associated with nightlife and transient populations, also recorded **69 incidents**.

## A Sharp Decline by 2019

By 2019, the numbers had plummeted to just **13 reported incidents** across the entire city‚Äîa **98% decrease** from 2014. The once-problematic Mission District saw only **six cases**, while Tenderloin reported **zero**. Law enforcement and city policies targeting public intoxication, along with broader societal shifts such as the decline of bar culture and increased use of rideshares, likely played a role in this drastic reduction.

## A Surprising Uptick in 2024

While drunkenness crimes remained relatively low, **2024 saw a modest increase to 31 cases**‚Äîmore than double the numbers from 2019. The **Southern District (15)** saw the most incidents, followed by the **Mission (10)**. This small uptick suggests a potential shift in behavior, possibly tied to the post-pandemic return of nightlife and public events.

## The Future of Public Intoxication in San Francisco

The dramatic fall in drunkenness crimes after 2014 is a testament to policy changes and social transformations in the city. However, the slight rise in 2024 raises questions about whether the trend may reverse as nightlife culture regains momentum. Will San Francisco continue to keep public intoxication at historic lows, or are we seeing the early signs of a resurgence? Only time will tell.
